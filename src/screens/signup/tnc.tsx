<p class="p5">4. Payment</p>
<p class="p4">You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (&ldquo;Charges &rdquo;). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, LawnQ will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. LawnQ reserves the right to charge you an additional amount for <span class="s2">lawn mowing</span> <span class="s2">service </span>provided at various <span class="s2">job </span>along with applicable taxes (including but not limited to GST). Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by LawnQ. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. LawnQ will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by LawnQ using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which LawnQ will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that LawnQ may, as the Third Party Provider&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. As between you and LawnQ, LawnQ reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in LawnQ&rsquo;s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. LawnQ will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. LawnQ may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers, subscriptions and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers,subscriptions and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider&rsquo;s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. LawnQ does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by LawnQ (on LawnQ&rsquo;s website, in the Application, or in LawnQ&rsquo;s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is &ldquo;voluntary,&rdquo; &ldquo;not required,&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;included&rdquo; in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that LawnQ provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party&nbsp;Provider.</p>
<p class="p6">Payment Authorization and Capture</p>

<p class="p6">LAWNQ GUIDELINES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES</p>
<p class="p4">The following guidelines are intended to inform law enforcement about the legal process for seeking records from LawnQ. These are merely guidelines, and this information may change at any time. For private party requests, including requests from civil litigants and criminal defendants, we recommend browsing Guidelines for Third Party Data&nbsp;Requests.</p>
<p class="p6">WHAT IS LAWNQ AND WHAT RECORDS DO WE HAVE?</p>
<p class="p4">LawnQ is a technology company that has developed an app that connects users (for <span class="s2">example: Home owners, commercial businesses and other lawn mowing services seekers</span>) with L<span class="s2">awn Mowing service providers </span>who provide <span class="s2">Lawn Mowing services </span>to the user. LawnQ is not a <span class="s2">Lawn Mowing service provider </span>, and does not employ any <span class="s2">Lawn mowing service providers</span>. Users can use the LawnQ App to request <span class="s2">lawn mowing services or goods</span> via their smartphone, the web. LawnQ users can choose from a variety of Service providers available in<span class="s2"> their</span> location. <span class="s2">When the service is complate</span>, both the <span class="s2">lawn mowing service provider and </span>user receive a copy of the fare receipt. More information about our services is available here. We store and maintain information as described in our Privacy Statements and our Terms of&nbsp;Use.</p>
<p class="p6">WHAT TYPE OF LEGAL PROCESS DOES LAWNQ REQUIRE BEFORE PRODUCING USER OR PARTNER INFORMATION?</p>
<p class="p4">For <span class="s2">Australia</span> Law Enforcement&nbsp;We require valid and sufficient legal process before we can disclose business records regarding partners, users, or <span class="s2">Jobs</span>. In most instances, we won&rsquo;t be able to provide any information without a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We accept law enforcement requests via email to <span class="s2">Support</span>@LawnQ.com Our acceptance <span class="s2">of the legal</span> process does not waive any legal objections LawnQ may have and may raise in response to the request.</p>
<p class="p4">For Non-<span class="s2">Australia</span>. Law Enforcement:&nbsp;We disclose business records only in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A valid <span class="s2">Australia</span> court order (via mutual legal assistance treaty, mutual legal assistance agreement, or letter rogatory) may be required to compel disclosure of certain records. We accept non-<span class="s2">Australia</span> requests via email to <span class="s2">Support</span>@LawnQ.c<span class="s2">om . Ou</span>r acceptance <span class="s2">of the legal</span> process does not waive any legal objections, LawnQ may have and may raise in response to the request.</p>
<p class="p6">WHAT FORM OF REQUESTS DOES LAWNQ REQUIRE, AND HOW ARE REQUESTS PROCESSED?</p>
<p class="p4">To respond to a request, we will need to receive the applicable process described above, as well as a valid return email address from an official government domain. We review each request for facial and substantive validity, and will reject requests that are not facially and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be narrowly tailored to a legitimate law enforcement need and will reject overly broad, vague, or unduly burdensome requests. In order to make sure your Law Enforcement Request is valid and does not seek more information than necessary, we ask for the following: A sufficiently narrow/defined time period; A specific event or action that the subject took; A specific reference (i.e., you must uniquely identify a user or driver partner) We disclose data to law enforcement when we determine that we are required to do so by law. In those instances, we will search for and disclose data that we are reasonably able to locate and&nbsp;retrieve.</p>
<p class="p6">HOW DOES LAWNQ HANDLE EMERGENCY REQUESTS?</p>
<p class="p4">We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency basis where there is an emergency that involves protecting a user, driver partner, or third party or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm. Requestors must submit an Emergency Request Form (which can be requested through <span class="s2">support</span>@LawnQ.com) that describes in detail the nature of the emergency, and we review these requests on a case-by-case basis. Law enforcement can submit an emergency request by emailing <span class="s2">support</span>@LawnQ.com. Please note that we will only review and respond to emergency requests from law enforcement, and will not respond to emergency requests sent to this address by non-law enforcement officials. Non-law enforcement officials aware of an emergency situation should immediately and directly contact local law enforcement&nbsp;officials.</p>
<p class="p6">DOES LAWNQ NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO THEM?</p>
<p class="p4">Yes, we may notify subjects before producing their information to law enforcement, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so, or in exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is&nbsp;prohibited.</p>
<p class="p6">DOES LAWNQ PROVIDE A CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION OR EXPERT TESTIMONY?</p>
<p class="p7">We may provide a certification from our records custodian but are not generally able to provide in-person or expert witness testimony. Law enforcement officials with questions about these guidelines should email <span class="s2">support</span>@LawnQ.com. Please note that we will not respond to non-law enforcement inquiries received at this email address. For non-law enforcement inquiries, please see Guidelines for Third Party Data&nbsp;Requests.</p>
